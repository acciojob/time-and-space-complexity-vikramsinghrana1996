    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to complete as the input size grows. Efficient algorithms with optimal time complexity are essential to ensure good performance, especially for large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run relative to its input size. It is often denoted in terms of Big-O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the input size. Optimizing Space Complexity is crucial to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
